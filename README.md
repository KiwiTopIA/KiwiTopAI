# KiwiTopAI

KiwiTopAI is the core workspace for **KiwiTopIA**, a robotics and AI studio focused on human wellbeing from Aotearoa New Zealand.

## Vision

Design and deploy assistive AI and robotics that:
- Support neurodivergent minds (e.g. ADHD) in daily life.
- Help with stroke recovery and long-term care.
- Reduce caregiver load through ethical, empathetic automation.
- Respect manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga in how systems are built and used.

## Repository layout

- `01_Admin/`
  - Company admin records (banking, NZ Companies Office, payment services).
- `02_Brand/`
  - Logos, brand assets, social banners, and promo videos.
  - Archive variants and drafts are kept separate from production-ready assets.
- `03_Website/`
  - Website exports and hero assets.
  - Visuals for posts, values, and vision pages.

## How this repo is used

- **Source of truth for assets** shared across website, social, and decks.
- **Backup** of key incorporation/admin documents.
- **Staging area** for future product and robotics projects (e.g. KiwiTopIA Mind Engine, assistive robots, caregiver dashboard).

## Next steps

- Add a `04_Product/` folder for technical designs and MVP specs.
- Document the KiwiTopAI system architecture (sensing, dialogue, ROS2, cloud).
- Add simple contribution & branching guidelines as engineering work begins.
